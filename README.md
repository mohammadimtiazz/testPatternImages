# testPatternImages
Python Script for creating different test pattern images 


testPattern.py ->
  create a blank image
  create a chass board images with pixel differnece 0 and 255 using given dimension
  create image with smooth gray value transcetion from 0,1,2...255 in vertical direction 
  create image with smooth gray value transcetion from 0,1,2...255 in Horizental direction 
  create image with gray value transcetion with higer contrast like 0,17,34...255 in vertical direction 
  create image with gray value transcetion with higer contrast like 0,17,34...255 in horizental direction  
  
testPattern2.py ->
  create images of gray level 16 by 16 matrix and each block is a 10 by 10 grid in total size it is a 160 by 160 image with smooth gray transection
  create images of gray level 16 by 16 matrix and each block is a 13 by 13 grid in where only 10 by 10 will be filled out with gray values.image size will be 256 256 


These output images can be used for measuring texture with different algorithm....As the input patterns are known, it will help to understand how the texture measurement algorithms are defining these patters.

these images can also be used for measuring brightness changes
